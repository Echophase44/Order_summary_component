# Order_summary_component

While this was a coding challenge, I treated this as a client project. The client was building out their store and needed a new modern payment component.

### The challenge

Create the desired look issued by the Design team.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- This was a great little project to solidify some concepts and apply it towards a possible real use case.

- Planning is essential. A few times I had to go back and refactor something instead of having it right the first time. Planning it out would have saved me a some time.
